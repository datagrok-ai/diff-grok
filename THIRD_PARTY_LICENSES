The LSODA solver implementation in src/solver-tools/lsoda/ is a TypeScript port
of the liblsoda C library by Simon Frost, which itself is derived from earlier
work tracing back to the original Fortran LSODA algorithm.

The CVODE solver implementation in src/solver-tools/cvode/ is a TypeScript port
of the CVODE module from the SUNDIALS library (SUite of Nonlinear and
DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers) v7.5.0, developed at the Center for
Applied Scientific Computing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

CVODE is a solver for stiff and nonstiff ODE systems using variable-order,
variable-step multistep methods: Adams-Moulton (nonstiff) and BDF (stiff).

Provenance chain:

  1. Lawrence Livermore National Security — original CVODE solver (C, 2002)
     Part of the SUNDIALS suite. Developed under U.S. Department of Energy
     Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.
     LLNL code release number: UCRL-CODE-155951
