# Summary
Differential equations play a crucial role in modeling complex systems and phenomena, 
with applications ranging from pharmacology and drug manufacturing 
to financial modeling and environmental studies.
Diff Studio is a TypeScript-based application designed for solving initial value problems 
in ordinary differential equations (ODEs) directly within web browsers, 
featuring real-time solution visualization. 
By allowing users to define models declaratively without the need for programming knowledge, 
it streamlines both model generation and exploration.
Diff Studio consists of two components. 
The first component is the [Diff Grok](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/DiffGrok) 
that implements numerical methods and formula parsing tools. 
The second component is [Diff Studio](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/DiffStudio),
an application that integrates these tools with [Datagrok](https://datagrok.ai/), 
a next-generation scientific computing platform. 

Diff Studio creates an ecosystem within the Datagrok platform 
that supports the quick development of specialized scientific applications 
while offering premises for model design and exploration. 
It enables the democratization of research by acting as a central repository for ODE models 
and guaranteeing the reproducibility and accessibility of results.

# Statement of need
Scientific modeling of complex processes and phenomena relies heavily on ordinary differential equations. 
Their applications span diverse fields, including physical processes [Carmen Chicone], 
biochemical kinetics [Ingalls Brian], drug delivery systems, [Mircioiu, C.], 
cloud computing [Einollah Jafarnejad Ghomi], and population dynamics [Alan Hastings].

While analytic methods provide exact solutions, they can be applied only to a limited class of ODEs. 
Moreover, in many cases, the use of analytic solutions proves impractical due to their complexity [Ernst Hairer]. 
Consequently, numerical methods, which compute approximate solutions, are often preferred.

Numerous methods for solving ODEs have been recently developed [Ernst Hairer 1, 2]. 
These methods have been implemented in various software tools, 
including libraries and packages for programming languages and scientific computing environments. 
Notable examples include SUNDIALS [gardner2022sundials, hindmarsh2005sundials], 
Julia Differential Equations package [rackauckas2017differentialequations], 
SciPy [2020SciPy-NMeth], Maple [Maple], Mathematica [Mathematica], 
Matlab [MATLAB], and deSolve [Soetaert K]. 

Though most existing tools require significant technical expertise, 
shifting emphasis from applied research to software development. 
The goal of this project is to develop  an ecosystem providing comprehensive capabilities 
for in-browser ODE modeling and analysis.

# The solution: Diff Studio
In this paper, we introduce Diff Studio – a JavaScript-based application 
designed to provide capabilities for in-browser ODE modeling and analysis 
for user without significant experience in software development.

Diff Studio facilitates rapid development and debugging of models defined by ODEs. 
It enables the efficient design of complex process and phenomena simulators with user-friendly interfaces.

The key features of Diff Studio include:
* Browser-based numerical solving of initial value problems for systems of ODEs;
* Declarative problem specification implementing a "no-code" approach;
* Support for solving both stiff and non-stiff ODE systems;
* Automatic generation of user interfaces;
* Interactive visualization and model exploration tools;
* Sensitivity analysis and parameter optimization functionality;
* Development of standalone applications directly from ODE’s system.
* Capabilities for sharing models and computational results;


The project architecture comprises two main components:
[Diff Grok](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/DiffGrok) 
is a library providing numerical methods and features 
for automatically generating JavaScript code to solve problems specified through declarative syntax. 
[Diff Studio](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/DiffStudio) 
is a production-ready modeling environment 
integrated within the Datagrok [https://datagrok.ai/], scientific computing platform.

## DiffGrok library

The Diff Grok library (DG-lib) consists of two main components:
* Solving tools: numerical methods providing approximate solutions of Initial Value Problems (IVPs);
* Scripting tools: methods for automatic generation of JavaScript code that  solves problems specified in declarative form.

**Solving tools** incorporate the following numerical methods:
* `mrt` - Modified Rosenbrock triple (MRT) [Shampine, Lawrence F.];
* `ros3prw` - the ROS3PRw method [Joachim Rang];
* `ros34prw` - the ROS34PRw method [Joachim Rang].

To solve
$$dy /dt = f(t, y)
y(t_0) = y_0$$

on the interval `[t0, t1]` with step size `h`, one must define an ODEs object. 
This object specifies the independent variable (t) and its range (`[t0, t1]`), 
solution grid step size (`h`), initial conditions ($y_0$), right-hand side of the ODEs, 
tolerance, and names of dependent variables. 
Subsequently, a selected method (`mrt`, `ros3prw` or `ros34prw`) is applied to this object. 
The output consists of an array of Float64Array arrays 
containing the values of the independent variable and the corresponding approximate solutions.

For example, consider 
$$
dx/dt = x + y - t                                                (1)
dy/dt = xy + t
x(0) = 1, y(0) = -1
t∊[0, 2], h = 0.001
$$

In this case, the ODEs object is defined as follows:

```javascript
const task: ODEs = {
    name: 'Example', 
    arg: {
        name: 't',
        start: 0,
        finish: 2,
        step: 0.001,
    },
    initial: [1, -1],
    func: (t: number, y: Float64Array, output: Float64Array) => { 
      output[0] = y[0] + y[1] - t;
      output[1] = y[0] * y[1] + t;
    },
    tolerance: 1e-7,
    solutionColNames: ['x', 'y'],
};
```

The following code:
```javascript
const solution = mrt(task);
```

solves the given problem. Here, solution contains three items:
`solution[0]` - values of t, i.e. the range `0..2` with the step `0.001`;
`solution[1]` - values of $x(t)$ at the points of this range;
`solution[2]` - values of $y(t)$ at the same points.

The library demonstrates outstanding computational performance. 
The subsequent section presents a performance analysis based on solving a set of classical benchmark problems.

The scripting tools enable specification of IVPs in a declarative form 
known as the **Diff Studio model** (DS-model), 
which employs an intuitive block-structured syntax. 
For example, the problem defined in (1) can be expressed as follows:

```
#name: Example
#equations:
    dx/dt = x + y - t
    dy/dt = x * y + t
#argument: t
    initial = 0
    final =  2
    step = 0.001
#inits:
    x = 1
    y = -1
#tolerance: 1e-7
```

The method getIVP parses strings of a DS-model and produces an IVP object specifying a problem. 
If a model contains invalid expressions, an error is raised. 
And the method getJScode generates JavaScript code, involving an appropriate ODEs object, 
that can be applied for in-browser solving differential equations. 
Besides, an intermediate IVP object can be used for the automatic creation of user interfaces. 
We have implemented these features when developing the Diff Studio application for the Datagrok platform.

### Performance

DG-lib ensures efficient integration of both stiff and non-stiff ODEs. 
To evaluate performance, we employ the following collection of classical benchmark problems:

* **Robertson**: A stiff system describing the kinetics of an autocatalytic reaction [H.H. Robertson];
* **HIRES**: A stiff system explaining photomorphogenesis phytochrome responses through a chemical reaction 
  involving eight reactants [E. Schafer];
* **VDPOL**: A system of ODEs describing nonlinear vacuum tube circuit behavior [van der Pol];
* **OREGO**: A stiff system simulating the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction [Ernst Hairer 2];
* **E5**: A stiff system of nonlinear ODEs representing a chemical pyrolysis model [Ernst Hairer 2];
* **Pollution**: A stiff system of nonlinear equations describing chemical reactions
  in an air pollution model developed at the Dutch National Institute 
  of Public Health and Environmental Protection [Verwer, J.].

**Table 1**. compares the computational performance of MRT, ROS3PRw, and ROS34PRw in solving these problems.

| Problem   | Equations | Segment       | Points | Tolerance | MRT, ms | ROS3PRw, ms | ROS34PRw, ms |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|--------|-----------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Robertson | 3         | [0, 10E+11]   | 40K    | 1E-7      | 103     | 446         | 285          |
| HIRES     | 8         | [0, 321.8122] | 32K    | 1E-10     | 222     | 362         | 215          |

| OREGO     | 3         | [0, 360]      | 36K    | 1E-8      | 381     | 483         | 199          |
| E5        | 4         | [0, 10E+13]   | 40K    | 1E-6      | 14      | 17          | 8            |
| Pollution | 20        | [0, 60]       | 30K    | 1E-6      | 36      | 50          | 23           |

The efficient computation allows users to see the modeling results in near-real time, 
thereby facilitating interactive model exploration and improvement.

## Diff Studio application

The Diff Studio application (DS-app) provides production-ready capabilities 
for solving initial value problems (IVPs) directly within a web browser. 
It integrates DG-lib with the Datagrok JavaScript API [js-api].

DS-app has a model editor (Fig. 3), where users can define mathematical expressions, 
such as those shown in Fig. 2. The application then parses these expressions and automatically 
generates the following components:

* **JavaScript script (JS-script)**:  The JS-script invokes methods from DS-tools, 
  and the Datagrok platform executes it to compute the numerical solution of the given IVP;
* **User interface (UI)**: The UI provides interactive controls for users to modify model inputs (Fig. 4). 
  Whenever a user updates the inputs, Datagrok reruns the JS-script to recompute the solution. 
  The results are displayed using a grid and line charts.

Figure 3.  The Diff Studio application: the equation editor, numerical solution of the problem (1) 
and its visualization.

Figure 4.  The Diff Studio application, Autogenerated UI: Diffstudio creates input entries for all variables 
listed in the equation editor. 
Each time model inputs are changed, a solution is computed and displayed.

DS-app generates the user interface (UI) based on the model specification. 
To enhance usability, each model input can be annotated with options that define the caption, 
category, measurement units, minimum and maximum values, and tooltips (see Fig. 5). 
Diff Studio provides the UI shown in Fig. 4, where inputs are displayed with their specified captions and units. 
Additionally, inputs belonging to the same category are grouped together. 
When a user hovers over an element, a tooltip appears, providing additional context.

Applying input annotations results in a self-explanatory UI. 
If minimum and maximum values are specified, a slider is generated, 
allowing users to adjust input values efficiently. 
Combined with the high computational performance of DS-app, this feature enables real-time, 
interactive model exploration.

DS-app highlights errors and invalid expressions (Fig. 6), 
which is particularly important when creating and debugging complex models.

DS-models can be stored on the Datagrok platform or downloaded to local storage as .ivp text files, 
where "ivp" denotes an initial value problem. 
Additionally, computation results and their visualizations can be saved as CSV and PNG files, respectively.

Thus, DS-app serves as a comprehensive scientific computing environment, 
facilitating both the development and application of models 
defined by systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

## Integration with Datagrok

An autogenerated JS-script is a  Datagrok function [datagrok/concepts/functions/], 
which constitutes a key feature for several reasons.

First, the platform executes the JS-script to compute a numerical solution for a given problem. 
The output of these computations is a dataframe, which is displayed in a grid and visualized using line charts. 
Users can further customize the output using Datagrok viewers [visualize/viewers/].

Second, the Datagrok platform offers advanced function analysis capabilities, 
which can be applied to any numerical platform function [https://datagrok.ai/help/compute/function-analysis]. 
Using **sensitivity analysis** you can explore how changes in input parameters affect your model outputs. 
**Parameter optimization** solves the reversed task, 
allowing you to find input parameters that generate a specified model output. 
These tools can be accessed directly from Diff Studio, enabling comprehensive model analysis and parameter fitting.

Third, the JS-script is modifiable. 
It can be extended to incorporate non-elementary and special functions, 
allowing for the simulation of a broader range of processes. 
Additionally, other Datagrok functions can be called within the script, further enhancing its functionality.

Finally, JS-script can be saved in Datagrok scripts. 
Hence, it can be called by other functions. 
Such a capability makes it possible to create building blocks for more complex applications.

Furthermore, Diff Studio supports the handling of IVP files within Datagrok. 
Any file with the .ivp extension is automatically opened in Diff Studio, 
triggering the computation process. 
Users can execute models simply by clicking on IVP files stored on the platform. 
Additionally, they can share links to these files with other users, enabling seamless collaboration. 
This feature allows researchers to efficiently share their results with colleagues, 
positioning Diff Studio as a centralized hub for models defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

In summary, the comprehensive capabilities of Diff Studio establish an interactive modeling ecosystem 
for ODE-based simulations.
